You can quickly copy and paste emojis.

## Features

I created this Chrome extension as a trial because I had never made one before. Pull requests are welcome.
Let's communicate with emojis and have fun together.

## Usage

Clone "EmojiGrabber" and import it from the Chrome extension management screen.

## Note
Originally, I was developing a freely customizable emoji copy and paste table for GitHub on [here](https://github.com/shimauma0312/github_emoji). I have now published a formatted version of this chaotic repository here. The original repository is private, so let me know if you want an invitation.

I plan to add features such as bookmarking and template tables. I'll make them when I feel like it.
